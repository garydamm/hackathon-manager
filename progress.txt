## Iteration 52 - Add EmailServiceImpl unit tests
- Implemented comprehensive EmailServiceImplTest.kt with 9 test cases
- Files changed:
  - Created: src/test/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/service/EmailServiceImplTest.kt
  - Updated: PRD.md (marked US-001 as complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - When mocking Resend CreateEmailResponse, use mock<CreateEmailResponse> { on { id } doReturn "value" } instead of builder pattern
  - Use lenient().whenever() in @BeforeEach when some tests don't use all mocked dependencies to avoid UnnecessaryStubbingException
  - ReflectionTestUtils.setField() is useful for injecting mocks into Spring-managed beans in tests
  - Email service tests should verify both HTML and text content for all email types
  - Console fallback mode should be tested separately from API mode
  - Coverage achieved: 100% for EmailServiceImpl (exceeds 80% requirement)
