# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

## Iteration 1 - Add JWT decoding utility (US-001)
- Implemented JWT token decoding utility in `frontend/src/utils/jwt.ts`
- Created helper functions: `decodeToken()`, `getTokenExpiration()`, `isTokenExpired()`, `getTimeUntilExpiration()`
- Set up Vitest testing infrastructure for the frontend
- Added comprehensive unit tests (18 tests covering all edge cases)

Files changed:
- Created: `frontend/src/utils/jwt.ts` (JWT decoding utility)
- Created: `frontend/src/utils/jwt.test.ts` (comprehensive unit tests)
- Created: `frontend/vitest.config.ts` (Vitest configuration)
- Created: `frontend/src/test/setup.ts` (test setup with jest-dom)
- Modified: `frontend/package.json` (added Vitest dependencies and test scripts)
- Modified: `PRD.md` (marked US-001 as complete)

Learnings for future iterations:
- The project had no unit testing infrastructure, so Vitest was added
- Frontend uses TypeScript strict mode - all code must pass typecheck
- JWT tokens use URL-safe base64 encoding (- and _ instead of + and /)
- Use fixed timestamps in tests to avoid rounding issues with Date.now()
- Tests should be comprehensive: test both happy path and error cases
- Pattern: Create utility in `src/utils/`, tests in same directory with `.test.ts` suffix
