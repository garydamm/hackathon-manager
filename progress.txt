# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

- Backend is Kotlin + Spring Boot in `src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/`
- Controllers in `controller/` directory, services in `service/` directory
- Frontend service uses api.get<T>, api.post<T>, api.put<T>, api.delete<T> for HTTP requests
- Typecheck: `./gradlew compileKotlin` for backend, `npx tsc --noEmit` for frontend
- Tests: `./gradlew test` for backend
- Modal state pattern: use useState with union type to manage multi-screen modals
- Reuse existing modal structure from CreateTeamModal (AnimatePresence, backdrop, motion.div)
- No tooltip UI component - use native HTML title attribute instead
- Backend DTOs in `src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/dto/` - check these for exact field names
- SubmissionStatus enum values: draft, submitted, under_review, accepted, rejected

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Add Project TypeScript types
- What was implemented: Added Project, CreateProjectRequest, UpdateProjectRequest interfaces and ProjectStatus type to frontend types
- Files changed: frontend/src/types/index.ts, PRD.md
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Backend ProjectResponse DTO includes teamName (not just teamId) - useful for display
  - Nullable fields use `| null` in TypeScript to match Kotlin nullable types
  - UUIDs from backend are represented as strings in TypeScript
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Add project service layer
- What was implemented: Created projectService with all CRUD and submission endpoints
- Files changed: frontend/src/services/projects.ts, PRD.md
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - getProjectByTeam returns null on 404 (when team has no project) - handled with try/catch
  - Service pattern: export const serviceName = { async method(): Promise<T> { return api.verb<T>(url) } }
  - All endpoints are under /projects path: /projects, /projects/{id}, /projects/team/{teamId}, /projects/hackathon/{hackathonId}
