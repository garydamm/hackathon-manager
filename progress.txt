# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- Frontend code is in /frontend directory, not /src
- TypeScript typecheck: use `cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit`
- Services pattern: export object with async methods, use api.get/post/put from ./api
- Types go in frontend/src/types/index.ts
- Backend uses UUID for IDs but frontend uses string type

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Teams service layer
- What was implemented:
  - Created `/frontend/src/services/teams.ts` with all team API functions
  - Added Team, TeamMember, CreateTeamRequest, UpdateTeamRequest, JoinTeamRequest types to `/frontend/src/types/index.ts`
- Files changed:
  - frontend/src/services/teams.ts (new)
  - frontend/src/types/index.ts (modified)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Follow existing hackathonService pattern in services/hackathons.ts
  - Backend endpoints are at /api/teams/*
  - regenerateInviteCode returns { inviteCode: string } object
  - getMyTeam can return null if user has no team
