# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

- Frontend uses Vite dev server on port 5173
- Playwright config should only include chromium project for simplicity (per non-goals)

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Install and configure Playwright
- What was implemented:
  - Installed @playwright/test v1.57.0 as dev dependency
  - Created playwright.config.ts with baseURL http://localhost:5173
  - Added "test:e2e": "playwright test" script to package.json
  - Updated .gitignore with test-results/, playwright-report/, playwright/.cache/
  - Created frontend/e2e/ directory with .gitkeep
- Files changed:
  - frontend/package.json
  - frontend/package-lock.json
  - frontend/playwright.config.ts (new)
  - frontend/.gitignore
  - frontend/e2e/.gitkeep (new)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Playwright browsers installed globally in ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/
  - Running `npm run test:e2e` will return "No tests found" until tests are added - this is expected
  - Typecheck passes with new config file
