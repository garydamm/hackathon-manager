# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Iteration 1 - Add archived_at timestamp to projects table (US-001)
- Created database migration V5__add_archived_at_to_projects.sql
- Added nullable archived_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE column to projects table
- Added index idx_projects_archived_at for query performance
- Updated Project.kt entity with archivedAt field
- Added unit test for archivedAt field persistence in ProjectRepositoryTest.kt
- Files changed:
  - src/main/resources/db/migration/V5__add_archived_at_to_projects.sql (new)
  - src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/entity/Project.kt
  - src/test/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/repository/ProjectRepositoryTest.kt
  - PRD.md (marked US-001 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Migration pattern: Use V{N}__description.sql for sequential migrations
  - Use nullable TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE for archive timestamps (follows existing pattern)
  - Always add index on timestamp columns used in WHERE clauses
  - When testing OffsetDateTime persistence, compare using .toInstant() to handle timezone differences
  - Follow testing strategy: Run controller/service tests, then specific repository test individually to avoid TestContainers resource exhaustion
