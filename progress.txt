# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

- Backend is Kotlin + Spring Boot in `src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/`
- Controllers in `controller/` directory, services in `service/` directory
- Frontend service uses api.get<T>, api.post<T>, api.put<T>, api.delete<T> for HTTP requests
- Typecheck: `./gradlew compileKotlin` for backend, `npx tsc --noEmit` for frontend
- Tests: `./gradlew test` for backend
- Modal state pattern: use useState with union type to manage multi-screen modals
- Reuse existing modal structure from CreateTeamModal (AnimatePresence, backdrop, motion.div)
- No tooltip UI component - use native HTML title attribute instead
- Backend DTOs in `src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/dto/` - check these for exact field names
- SubmissionStatus enum values: draft, submitted, under_review, accepted, rejected

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Add Project TypeScript types
- What was implemented: Added Project, CreateProjectRequest, UpdateProjectRequest interfaces and ProjectStatus type to frontend types
- Files changed: frontend/src/types/index.ts, PRD.md
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Backend ProjectResponse DTO includes teamName (not just teamId) - useful for display
  - Nullable fields use `| null` in TypeScript to match Kotlin nullable types
  - UUIDs from backend are represented as strings in TypeScript
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Add project service layer
- What was implemented: Created projectService with all CRUD and submission endpoints
- Files changed: frontend/src/services/projects.ts, PRD.md
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - getProjectByTeam returns null on 404 (when team has no project) - handled with try/catch
  - Service pattern: export const serviceName = { async method(): Promise<T> { return api.verb<T>(url) } }
  - All endpoints are under /projects path: /projects, /projects/{id}, /projects/team/{teamId}, /projects/hackathon/{hackathonId}
---

## Iteration 3 - US-003: Create ProjectCard component
- What was implemented: Created ProjectCard component with status badge, team name, submission date, and URL links
- Files changed: frontend/src/components/ProjectCard.tsx, PRD.md
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Card pattern: use motion.div wrapper with Card from @/components/ui/card
  - URL icons use native title attribute for tooltips (no tooltip UI component)
  - Use e.stopPropagation() on link clicks to prevent card click handler from firing
  - Lucide icons: Globe for demo, Video for video, Github for repository, Presentation for presentation
  - Status colors: draft=gray, submitted=blue, under_review=yellow, accepted=green, rejected=red
---

## Iteration 4 - US-004: Create ProjectDetailModal component
- What was implemented: Created ProjectDetailModal component to display full project details in a modal
- Files changed: frontend/src/components/ProjectDetailModal.tsx, PRD.md
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Modal pattern for display-only: simpler than action modals - no modalState management needed
  - Use max-w-2xl for modals with more content, max-w-md for simpler ones
  - Use max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto for modals that could have long content
  - ExternalLink icon from lucide-react useful for indicating links open in new tab
  - whitespace-pre-wrap preserves line breaks in description text
---

## Iteration 5 - US-005: Create ProjectForm component
- What was implemented: Created ProjectForm component for creating and editing projects
- Files changed: frontend/src/components/ProjectForm.tsx, PRD.md
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Form modal pattern: use react-hook-form with zodResolver for validation
  - Support both create/edit modes via optional project prop (isEditMode = !!project)
  - Use .optional().or(z.literal("")) for optional URL fields that can be empty strings
  - Reset form values in useEffect when isOpen changes to handle both modes cleanly
  - Use max-w-lg for form modals with many fields (larger than max-w-md)
  - Button text should change based on mode: "Create Project" vs "Save Changes"
  - Different header icons: FolderPlus for create, Pencil for edit
---

## Iteration 6 - US-006: Add project section to TeamDetailPage
- What was implemented: Added Project section to TeamDetailPage with create/edit functionality
- Files changed: frontend/src/pages/TeamDetailPage.tsx, PRD.md
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Project section only visible to team members (isOnThisTeam check)
  - Edit button only shown for draft projects (project.status === "draft")
  - Use separate state for editingProject to track which project is being edited
  - Clean empty strings from form data before sending to API (convert "" to undefined)
  - Use FolderKanban icon for Project section header
  - projectService.getProjectByTeam returns null on 404 (no project yet)
  - Mutation pattern: mutateAsync for chained operations, mutate for simple fire-and-forget
