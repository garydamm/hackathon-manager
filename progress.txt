# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

- Frontend uses Vite dev server on port 5173
- Playwright config should only include chromium project for simplicity (per non-goals)
- E2E tests should register their own users via UI, not rely on seed data
- Password requirements: 8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number (e.g., TestPassword123)
- Generate unique emails with timestamps to avoid test conflicts
- Seed data (seed.sql) uses $2b$ bcrypt hashes but Spring BCrypt produces $2a$ - they're incompatible
- Use generateUniqueEmail() with timestamps to avoid email conflicts between test runs
- Login page form fields: getByLabel('Email'), getByLabel('Password')
- Submit button: 'Sign in' -> 'Signing in...' during submission
- Dashboard welcome: getByRole('heading', { name: /Welcome back, {firstName}/ })
- Error messages: .bg-destructive\/10 class selector
- Tests run in parallel by default; beforeAll runs once per worker
- Registration form fields: First name, Last name, Email, Password (exact: true), Confirm password
- Submit button: 'Create account' -> 'Creating account...' during submission

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Add dashboard display tests
- What was implemented:
  - Created frontend/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts with 3 tests
  - Test: displays welcome message with user name after login
  - Test: displays Create Hackathon button (verifies link and href)
  - Test: displays Open for Registration section heading
- Files changed:
  - frontend/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts (new)
  - PRD.md (marked US-001 criteria complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Dashboard sections like "Your Drafts", "Happening Now" are conditionally rendered based on data
  - The "Open for Registration" section is always visible (even with empty state)
  - Create Hackathon is a Link component, use getByRole('link') not getByRole('button')
  - beforeEach should login and wait for dashboard before each test
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Add navigation and logout tests
- What was implemented:
  - Created frontend/e2e/navigation.spec.ts with 3 tests
  - Test: clicking logo navigates to dashboard (navigates away, clicks HackathonHub link, verifies return)
  - Test: logout button is visible in nav when authenticated
  - Test: clicking logout clears session and redirects to login page (includes redirect protection check)
- Files changed:
  - frontend/e2e/navigation.spec.ts (new)
  - PRD.md (marked US-002 criteria complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Logo/home link uses text "HackathonHub", select with getByRole('link', { name: 'HackathonHub' })
  - Logout button: getByRole('button', { name: 'Logout' })
  - Logout clears localStorage and redirects to /login
  - After logout, navigating to / redirects back to /login (protected route)
  - Create Hackathon page is at /hackathons/new
---

## Iteration 3 - US-003: Add hackathon creation happy path tests
- What was implemented:
  - Created frontend/e2e/hackathon-create.spec.ts with 4 tests
  - Test: navigates to create hackathon page via dashboard button
  - Test: displays all form sections (Basic Information, Date & Time, Location, Team Settings)
  - Test: fills out required fields and submits successfully
  - Test: redirects to dashboard after successful creation
- Files changed:
  - frontend/e2e/hackathon-create.spec.ts (new)
  - PRD.md (marked US-003 criteria complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Create Hackathon form sections: Basic Information, Date & Time, Location, Team Settings, Branding
  - Required fields: Hackathon Name (auto-generates slug), Start Date & Time, End Date & Time
  - Labels use asterisk for required fields: 'Hackathon Name *', 'Start Date & Time *', 'End Date & Time *'
  - Submit button: 'Create Hackathon' -> 'Creating...' during submission
  - After successful creation, redirects to dashboard (/) not to hackathon detail page
  - Use datetime-local format for date fields: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm (e.g., toISOString().slice(0, 16))
  - generateUniqueHackathonName() pattern: include timestamp to avoid conflicts
---

## Iteration 4 - US-004: Add hackathon detail view tests
- What was implemented:
  - Created frontend/e2e/hackathon-detail.spec.ts with 4 tests
  - Test: navigates to hackathon detail page
  - Test: displays hackathon name, description, and status badge
  - Test: displays quick info cards (start date, end date, location, participants)
  - Test: displays rules section when rules are present (includes editing to add rules)
- Files changed:
  - frontend/e2e/hackathon-detail.spec.ts (new)
  - PRD.md (marked US-004 criteria complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Detail page URL pattern: /hackathons/{slug}
  - Hackathon name displayed as h1: getByRole('heading', { name: hackathonName, level: 1 })
  - Default status when publishImmediately=true (form default) is "Registration Open", not "Draft"
  - About section shows description, Rules & Guidelines section shows rules (both conditionally rendered)
  - Quick info cards have labels: "Starts", "Ends", "Location", "Participants"
  - Edit button visible to organizer: getByRole('button', { name: 'Edit' })
  - Save button in edit mode: getByRole('button', { name: 'Save Changes' })
  - Edit form fields use simpler labels (e.g., "Name" not "Hackathon Name *")
  - Use test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' }) when tests share state created in beforeAll
  - Slug is generated from name: lowercase with spaces replaced by dashes
