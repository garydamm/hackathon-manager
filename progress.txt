# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Iteration 1 - Add JWT decoding utility (US-001)
- Implemented JWT token decoding utility in `frontend/src/utils/jwt.ts`
- Created helper functions: `decodeToken()`, `getTokenExpiration()`, `isTokenExpired()`, `getTimeUntilExpiration()`
- Set up Vitest testing infrastructure for the frontend
- Added comprehensive unit tests (18 tests covering all edge cases)

Files changed:
- Created: `frontend/src/utils/jwt.ts` (JWT decoding utility)
- Created: `frontend/src/utils/jwt.test.ts` (comprehensive unit tests)
- Created: `frontend/vitest.config.ts` (Vitest configuration)
- Created: `frontend/src/test/setup.ts` (test setup with jest-dom)
- Modified: `frontend/package.json` (added Vitest dependencies and test scripts)
- Modified: `PRD.md` (marked US-001 as complete)

Learnings for future iterations:
- The project had no unit testing infrastructure, so Vitest was added
- Frontend uses TypeScript strict mode - all code must pass typecheck
- JWT tokens use URL-safe base64 encoding (- and _ instead of + and /)
- Use fixed timestamps in tests to avoid rounding issues with Date.now()
- Tests should be comprehensive: test both happy path and error cases
- Pattern: Create utility in `src/utils/`, tests in same directory with `.test.ts` suffix

## Iteration 2 - Implement proactive token refresh timer (US-002)
- Created TokenRefreshTimer class in `frontend/src/utils/refreshTimer.ts`
- Timer automatically refreshes tokens 5 minutes before expiration
- Integrated refresh timer with authService (starts on login/register/refresh, clears on logout)
- Added `initializeRefreshTimer()` to restart timer on app load
- Added comprehensive unit tests (17 tests covering all scenarios)

Files changed:
- Created: `frontend/src/utils/refreshTimer.ts` (refresh timer implementation)
- Created: `frontend/src/utils/refreshTimer.test.ts` (comprehensive unit tests)
- Modified: `frontend/src/services/auth.ts` (integrated refresh timer)
- Modified: `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (initialize timer on app load)
- Modified: `PRD.md` (marked US-002 acceptance criteria as complete)

Learnings for future iterations:
- Timer uses singleton pattern with a single global instance
- Timer must clear itself after execution (set timerId to null in finally block)
- Use fake timers in tests (vi.useFakeTimers()) for reliable timing tests
- Async callbacks in tests require await vi.runAllTimersAsync() to complete
- Console logging for debugging is helpful for timer operations
- REFRESH_BUFFER_MS is 5 minutes (300 seconds) as per requirements
- Timer handles edge cases: immediate refresh if < 5 min remaining, invalid tokens
- authService now has startRefreshTimer() and initializeRefreshTimer() methods
- AuthContext initializes timer on mount when user is already logged in
- Timer is fully integrated: starts on login/register, restarts on refresh, clears on logout, initializes on app load

---

## Iteration 3 - Create session countdown UI component (US-003)
- Created SessionCountdown component that displays remaining session time
- Component shows countdown when < 10 minutes remain (unobtrusive)
- Updates every second using setInterval
- Conditional styling: yellow/warning when < 5 minutes, blue/normal when >= 5 minutes
- Fixed positioning in top-right corner (below navbar at top-16)
- Automatically hides when > 10 minutes remain
- Added comprehensive unit tests (18 tests covering all scenarios)

Files changed:
- Created: `frontend/src/components/SessionCountdown.tsx` (countdown component)
- Created: `frontend/src/components/SessionCountdown.test.tsx` (comprehensive unit tests)
- Modified: `PRD.md` (marked US-003 as complete)

Learnings for future iterations:
- Use `act()` from React Testing Library to wrap timer advances in tests
- Timer state updates must be wrapped in `act()` to avoid warnings
- Component visibility logic: only show when time is in specific range (< 10 min)
- Format time conditionally: show hours+minutes for > 1hr, minutes+seconds otherwise
- Use `window.clearInterval` instead of `global.clearInterval` for TypeScript
- Fixed positioning classes: `fixed top-16 right-4 z-40` places below navbar
- Accessibility: use `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` for screen readers
- Conditional CSS classes using template literals for warning vs normal states
- Component uses lucide-react icons (Clock icon) - consistent with existing patterns
- Test all edge cases: visibility thresholds, formatting, styling transitions, cleanup
