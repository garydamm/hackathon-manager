## Iteration 22 - Add backend endpoint to promote participant to organizer (US-001)
- Implemented POST /api/hackathons/{hackathonId}/organizers endpoint in HackathonController
- Added PromoteOrganizerRequest DTO with UUID validation
- Implemented HackathonService.promoteToOrganizer() method with full validation
- Files changed:
  - src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/controller/HackathonController.kt
  - src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/dto/HackathonDtos.kt
  - src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/service/HackathonService.kt
  - src/test/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/service/HackathonServiceTest.kt
  - PRD.md (marked US-001 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Follow existing exception patterns: UnauthorizedException for auth failures, NotFoundException for missing resources, ValidationException for business rule violations
  - Use @Valid annotation on request bodies to trigger Jakarta validation
  - Service methods should check authorization first (isUserOrganizer), then validate hackathon exists, then validate target user state
  - Return the updated list of resources after mutations for better UX
  - Test coverage should include: success case, authorization failures, not found cases, and validation failures
  - Backend controller/service tests run successfully with `./gradlew test --tests '*ControllerTest' --tests '*ServiceTest'`
  - Typecheck passes with `./gradlew build -x test`
