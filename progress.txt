# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

- Backend is Kotlin + Spring Boot in `src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/`
- Frontend is React + Vite in `frontend/`
- Typecheck: `./gradlew compileKotlin` for backend, `npx tsc --noEmit` for frontend
- Tests: `./gradlew test` for backend (JaCoCo 70% coverage required)
- Application config in `src/main/resources/application.yml`
- Security config in `src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/config/SecurityConfig.kt`

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Run existing backend tests
- What was implemented: Ran `./gradlew test` and `./gradlew jacocoTestCoverageVerification`. Coverage was at 69%, below 70% threshold.
- Added tests for JwtConfig and CorsConfig/CorsProperties to boost coverage to 70%+
- Files changed:
  - `src/test/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/config/JwtConfigTest.kt` (created)
  - `src/test/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/config/CorsConfigTest.kt` (created)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Tests use AssertJ for assertions (not kotlin.test or JUnit)
  - `org.springframework.mock.web.MockHttpServletRequest` available for testing CORS
  - Config data classes (CorsProperties, JwtConfig) were at 0% coverage - easy wins
  - `./gradlew jacocoTestCoverageVerification` to verify the 70% threshold
