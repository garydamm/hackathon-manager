# Progress Log

## Learnings
- `aria-hidden="true"` removes elements from the accessibility tree — can't use `getByRole` on them; use `data-testid` instead
- Frontend has no dedicated `typecheck` script — use `npx tsc -b` directly
- UI components follow shadcn/ui patterns: forwardRef, cn utility, displayName, extend HTML attributes
- Testing uses vitest + @testing-library/react + MemoryRouter for components with react-router Links

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create Breadcrumb UI component
- Created `frontend/src/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx` with 6 composable parts: Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbList, BreadcrumbItem, BreadcrumbLink, BreadcrumbSeparator, BreadcrumbPage
- Created `frontend/src/components/ui/breadcrumb.test.tsx` with 9 unit tests covering rendering, links, separators, truncation, className forwarding
- Files changed: breadcrumb.tsx (new), breadcrumb.test.tsx (new), PRD.md (marked US-001 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - BreadcrumbLink uses react-router-dom `Link` component, needs `MemoryRouter` wrapper in tests
  - maxLength truncation uses inline styles (maxWidth in ch units, overflow hidden, text-overflow ellipsis)
  - BreadcrumbSeparator has aria-hidden="true" so it's invisible to role-based queries
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Create useBreadcrumbs hook
- Created `frontend/src/hooks/useBreadcrumbs.ts` with `useBreadcrumbs(overrides?)` hook
- Created `frontend/src/hooks/useBreadcrumbs.test.ts` with 14 unit tests covering simple paths, nested paths, override resolution, slug formatting, settings path, last segment no href
- Files changed: useBreadcrumbs.ts (new), useBreadcrumbs.test.ts (new), PRD.md (marked US-002 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Hook is pure: derives segments from useLocation().pathname + overrides map, no side effects
  - Static labels take precedence over overrides (e.g., "schedule" always maps to "Schedule")
  - `hackathons` segment is skipped in display but kept in href building
  - Mocking useLocation for hook tests: `vi.mock("react-router-dom", () => ({ useLocation: () => ({ pathname: mockPathname() }) }))`
  - `renderHook` from @testing-library/react works for pure hooks without needing wrapper providers
  - `BreadcrumbSegment` interface exported: `{ label: string, href?: string }`
---

## Iteration 3 - US-003: Integrate breadcrumb into AppLayout navbar
- Modified `frontend/src/components/layouts/AppLayout.tsx` to render breadcrumb as second row inside `<nav>`
- Breadcrumb row only renders when `segments.length >= 2` (hidden on Dashboard)
- Uses `border-t border-border` for subtle separator, same `max-w-7xl` + padding for alignment
- Dynamic (hackathon name) segments truncated at 30 chars via `maxLength` prop
- Files changed: AppLayout.tsx (modified), PRD.md (marked US-003 complete), progress.txt
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - `useBreadcrumbs()` can be called without overrides in AppLayout — pages wire overrides in US-004
  - Hackathon name detection uses exclusion of known static labels (Dashboard, Schedule, Teams, etc.)
  - BreadcrumbSeparator placed inside BreadcrumbItem for each non-first segment (avoids key issues)
