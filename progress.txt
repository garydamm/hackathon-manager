# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- Running `./gradlew test --tests '*ControllerTest'` fails on multi-project builds because mcp-server subproject has no matching tests. Use `:test` to scope to main project: `./gradlew :test --tests '*ControllerTest' --tests '*ServiceTest'`

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Include members in teams-by-hackathon API response
- Changed `TeamService.getTeamsByHackathon()` to pass `includeMembers = true` to `TeamResponse.fromEntity()`
- Updated `TeamControllerTest` helper `createTeamResponse()` to include a `TeamMemberResponse` with `UserResponse` data
- Updated test `getTeamsByHackathon should return teams with members` to verify `members` array, `isLeader` flag, and `user.displayName` in JSON response
- Files changed:
  - `src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/service/TeamService.kt` (1 line change)
  - `src/test/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/controller/TeamControllerTest.kt` (imports + helper data + test assertions)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Use `:test` not `test` for Gradle test commands to avoid mcp-server subproject failures
  - `TeamMemberResponse` includes `user: UserResponse` and `isLeader: Boolean` — ready for avatar display in frontend
