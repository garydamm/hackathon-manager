## Iteration 3 - Add authentication check for archived hackathon access (US-003)
- Added archived field to HackathonResponse DTO in backend
- Updated HackathonResponse.fromEntity() to include archived field
- Modified HackathonService.getHackathonBySlug() to require authentication for archived hackathons
- Modified HackathonService.getHackathonById() to require authentication for archived hackathons
- Added archived field to frontend Hackathon TypeScript interface
- Added amber-colored archived banner to HackathonDetail.tsx page with Archive icon
- Added 4 unit tests for archived hackathon authentication checks:
  - Test authenticated access to archived hackathon by slug (should succeed)
  - Test unauthenticated access to archived hackathon by slug (should throw UnauthorizedException)
  - Test authenticated access to archived hackathon by ID (should succeed)
  - Test unauthenticated access to archived hackathon by ID (should throw UnauthorizedException)
- Fixed HackathonControllerTest to include archived field in test helper methods
- Files changed:
  - src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/dto/HackathonDtos.kt (added archived field)
  - src/main/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/service/HackathonService.kt (added auth checks)
  - frontend/src/types/index.ts (added archived field to Hackathon interface)
  - frontend/src/pages/HackathonDetail.tsx (added archived banner)
  - src/test/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/service/HackathonServiceTest.kt (added 4 tests)
  - src/test/kotlin/com/hackathon/manager/controller/HackathonControllerTest.kt (fixed helper)
  - PRD.md (marked US-003 complete except browser verification)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Authentication checks in service layer use `userId == null` to detect unauthenticated requests
  - UnauthorizedException is the correct exception for auth failures (not NotFoundException)
  - HackathonResponse DTO must stay in sync with Hackathon entity fields
  - Controller tests have helper methods that need updating when DTO structure changes
  - Frontend banner uses Tailwind's amber color palette (amber-50, amber-200, amber-600, amber-700, amber-900)
  - Archive icon imported from lucide-react works well for archived state visualization
